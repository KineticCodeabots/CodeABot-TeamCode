 * This is (mostly) the OpMode used in the goBILDA Robot in 3 Days for the 24-25 Into The Deep FTC Season.
 * https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpytbFEB5mLcWxf6rOHqbmYjDi9BbK00p&si=NyQLwyIkcZvZEirP (playlist of videos)
 * I've gone through and added comments for clarity. But most of the code remains the same.
 * This is very much based on the code for the Starter Kit Robot for the 24-25 season. Those resources can be found here:
 * https://www.gobilda.com/ftc-starter-bot-resource-guide-into-the-deep/
 *
 * There are three main additions to the starter kit bot code, mecanum drive, a linear slide for reaching
 * into the submersible, and a linear slide to hang (which we didn't end up using)
 *
 * the drive system is all 5203-2402-0019 (312 RPM Yellow Jacket Motors) and it is based on a Strafer chassis
 * The arm shoulder takes the design from the starter kit robot. So it uses the same 117rpm motor with an
 * external 5:1 reduction
 *
 * The drivetrain is set up as "field centric" with the internal control hub IMU. This means
 * when you push the stick forward, regardless of robot orientation, the robot drives away from you.
 * We "took inspiration" (copy-pasted) the drive code from this GM0 page
 * (PS GM0 is a world class resource, if you've got 5 mins and nothing to do, read some GM0!)

            This is probably my favorite piece of code on this robot. It's a clever little software
            solution to a problem the robot has.
            This robot has an extending lift on the end of an arm shoulder. That arm shoulder should
            run to a specific angle, and stop there to collect from the field. And the angle that
            the shoulder should stop at changes based on how long the arm is (how far the lift is extended)
            so here, we add a compensation factor based on how far the lift is extended.
            That comp factor is multiplied by the number of mm the lift is extended, which
            results in the number of degrees we need to fudge our arm up by to keep the end of the arm
            the same distance from the field.
            Now we don't need this to happen when the arm is up and in scoring position. So if the arm
            is above 45Â°, then we just set armLiftComp to 0. It's only if it's below 45Â° that we set it

            /* Here we set the lift position based on the driver input.
            This is a.... weird, way to set the position of a "closed loop" device. The lift is run
            with encoders. So it knows exactly where it is, and there's a limit to how far in and
            out it should run. Normally with mechanisms like this we just tell it to run to an exact
            position. This works a lot like our arm. Where we click a button and it goes to a position, then stops.
            But the drivers wanted more "open loop" controls. So we want the lift to keep extending for
            as long as we hold the bumpers, and when we let go of the bumper, stop where it is at.
            This allows the driver to manually set the position, and not have to have a bunch of different
            options for how far out it goes. But it also lets us enforce the end stops for the slide
            in software. So that the motor can't run past it's endstops and stall.
            We have our liftPosition variable, which we increment or decrement for every cycle (every
            time our main robot code runs) that we're holding the button. Now since every cycle can take
            a different amount of time to complete, and we want the lift to move at a constant speed,
            we measure how long each cycle takes with the cycletime variable. Then multiply the
            speed we want the lift to run at (in mm/sec) by the cycletime variable. There's no way
            that our lift can move 2800mm in one cycle, but since each cycle is only a fraction of a second,
            we are only incrementing it a small amount each cycle.
